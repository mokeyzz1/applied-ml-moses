### Introduction
In this project, I use the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using three classification models: **Decision Tree**, **Support Vector Machine (SVC)**, and **Neural Network (MLP)**.  
The goal is to compare how well each model performs when trained on different feature combinations and to evaluate performance using accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrices.
